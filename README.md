# Picture in Picture

In this project, I have used the screen capture API.

Using this, we can have any video running on the screen while doing other tasks.

This is a fun tool you can use in your workplace to pretend like you're working, but instead watch movies. Okay, I'm kidding. Don't do that.

We can resize it. We can move it. And it will always stay on top. We can do anything in the background while watching any video on the screen, like a miniplayer.
